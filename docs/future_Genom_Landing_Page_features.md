# Feature list for future Genome Landing Page redesign

Checked boxes indicate feature is on existing page or there is a new prototype.

### Sequencing and assembly quality
- [X] Number of contigs
- [X] Contig length distribution
- [X] Contig %GC distribution
- [ ] Sequencing coverage
- [ ] Something about quality and closure of sequence
- [ ] Could propagate sequence quality measures in some cases (?)

### Genome metadata
- [X] Image and description (wikipedia)
- [X] Taxonomy
- [X] Literature
- [ ] Some depiction of the replicons and their key properties
(including location eg. K. lactis has a nuclear genome and a
cytoplasmic plasmid with an orthogonal replication system) (?)
- [ ] Key tables for different genome types (?)

### Structural and functional annotation quality
- [X] Functional category representation (on existing page but not possible with current data API)
- [ ] Measurements of goodness of annotation (number of specifically
annotated genes, etc. etc. with possible linkage to supporting data)
- [ ] Annotation completeness for conserved functions
- [ ] Fraction of inferred genes covered by functional annotations
- [ ] Function agreement as a function of tree distance, based on
set of close neighbors, taxonomy level
- [ ] Functional enrichments (and repeat for steps above using 'functional category')

###Functional genomics-based comparisons
- [ ] Transcript and proteome comparison for structural annotation (between different genomes)
- [ ] Transcript verification (eg based on RNA sequencing)
- [ ] Proteome verification (eg based on MS)
- [ ] Metabolic model comparison, etc
